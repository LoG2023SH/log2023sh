        <p class="lead"> 
          The conference theme, "Theory, Models, and Applications of Geometric Deep Learning," aligns with the current AI research focus on understanding AI algorithm capabilities and limitations. Deep learning methods, like convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks, have seen rich theoretical advancements. Geometric deep learning offers a unified framework, addressing properties such as permutation invariance and rotation invariance. Its applications span quantum computing, 3D perception, drug design, and more, exemplified by AlphaFold's protein structure predictions. 
          However, these structure-aware networks often lack a solid mathematical foundation. This workshop unites mathematicians and computer scientists to establish the mathematical theory of geometric deep learning, fostering reliable topological structures and efficient computing units for deep neural networks while addressing current scientific challenges. </p>
        <!-- <p class="lead">Our workshop, "Mathematics of Geometric Deep Learning” (MGDL), .... </p> -->
        <!-- <p class="lead"> MGDL will be an in-person AND online workshop with hybrid elements (livestream + chat for questions) in <b>Room 288 - 289 on Saturday, December 3rd, 2022</b> at <a href="https://neurips.cc">NeurIPS</a>. </p> -->

        <h2 class="LoG Conference">LoG</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Learning on Graphs conference (LoG) is an annual research conference that covers areas broadly related to machine learning on graphs and geometry, with a special focus on review quality. In its inaugural edition, LoG 2022 received 250+ paper submissions, 2,800+ total registrations, and distributed $30,000+ in reviewer awards.
        <br/><br/>
          LoG 2023 will be a 4-day virtual event via Zoom + GatherTown and completely free to attend (dates: 27th – 30th November 2023).
          At the same time, LoG 2023 aims to host a ‘network’ of local mini-conferences around the world. This decision builds upon the success and positive reception of LoG 2022 local meetups in Cambridge, MIT, Stanford, Mila, and Würzburg (300+ attendees in total). 
          The objective is to connect participants belonging to the same geographic area, improving their social experience and fostering discussion and collaboration.
        <br/></br>
          LoG 2023 Shanghai Meetup is held jointly by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Peking University on 29 Nov - 1 Dec 2023.

        <p>Prof Xavier Bresson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS). His research focuses on Graph Deep Learning, a new framework that combines graph theory and neural networks to tackle complex data domains. In 2017, he received the USD 2M NRF Fellowship, the largest individual grant in Singapore, to develop this new framework. He was also awarded several research grants in the U.S. and Hong Kong. He co-authored one of the most cited works in this domain (10th most cited paper at NeurIPS) and has significantly contributed to mature these emerging techniques. He has organized several conferences, workshops and tutorials on graph deep learning such as the 2022 conference on “Learning on Graphs”, the IPAM'23 workshops on "Learning and Emergence in Molecular Systems", the IPAM'23'21 workshops on "Deep Learning and Combinatorial Optimization", the MLSys'21 workshop on "Graph Neural Networks and Systems", the IPAM'19 and IPAM'18 workshops on "New Deep Learning Techniques", and the NeurIPS'17, CVPR'17 and SIAM'18 tutorials on "Geometric Deep Learning on Graphs and Manifolds". He has been a regular invited speaker at universities and companies to share his work. He has also been a speaker at the NeurIPS'22, KDD'21, AAAI'21 and ICML'20 workshops on "Graph Representation Learning", and the ICLR'20 workshop on "Deep Neural Models and Differential Equations". 
          He has taught undergraduate and graduate courses on Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks since 2014.
